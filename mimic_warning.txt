Your Flatpak version does not support the expose-pids flag,
which means that this Brave Flatpak will have to run in a
less performant / efficient method. (This generally happens if
your distro's bubblewrap installation is setuid instead of
using user namespaces.)

In order for bubblewrap to use user namespaces, run the
following commands as root:

echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
sysctl -p
bash -c 'chmod -s $(which bwrap)'
